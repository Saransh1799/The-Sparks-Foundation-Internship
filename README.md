# TASK 1 : PREDICTION USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
 Problem Statement: Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
 Implementation: This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.You can use R, Python or any other tool. I preferred using Python because of my command.  Further we need to predict --> What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?   Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
